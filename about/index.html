    <p class="lead text-center">
      LoboSec is the official Capture The Flag (CTF) team at the University of New Mexico (UNM), created as part of an initiative by Professor <a href="https://www.afsah.org" class="url-lobo" target="_blank">Afsah Anwar</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      Our team is dedicated to participating in a wide range of cybersecurity competitions, from traditional Jeopardy-style CTFs to realistic attack-defense scenarios. We cover the entire spectrum — from blue team (defensive) to red team (offensive) challenges — giving members the chance to explore all aspects of cybersecurity.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-3">
      Whether you're just getting started or already have experience in reverse engineering, web exploitation, cryptography, forensics, or binary exploitation — there's a place for you here. We welcome students of all skill levels and backgrounds who are curious about cybersecurity and motivated to learn.
